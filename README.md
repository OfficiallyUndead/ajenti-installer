# Ajenti Installer

 - This is a simple installer for Ajenti Control Panel.
 - I created this for use on Ubuntu (I made it on 14.04 Server)
 - It may work for other distributions with minor tweaks
 - Your free to modify it as you wish, to your specific requirements
 - I recommend to use this on a new installation
 - It also installs a few things that I find useful when managing my server

## To Use
 - Download the installer.sh file to a location of your choice
 - Use 'chmod +x installer.sh' to make the installer executable
 - Use 'sh installer.sh' to start the installer
 - You will be prompted to enter your root password (because the script is installing packages)
